<h1>Toast Blog</h1>
    <div>Septmber 28th, 2025: Blog Maintence Update 1</div>
        <p> I have set up some basic CSS to add a little bit of color throughout the page. The title bar now has some flair, and the update breaks have some as well.
        I do not anticipate much more than this for now. But this is an exciting update! I will keep you posted.

    <div>September 29th, 2025: Blog Maintence Update 2</div> 
    <p>I have managed to set up a CSS styling sheet with fonts, colors, etc. All that is left now is to figure out a proper background, header, etc. But I like things
        simple enough. I will keep you posted with updates
