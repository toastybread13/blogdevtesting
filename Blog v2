    <h1>Toast Blog</h1>
    <div>Septmber 28th, 2025: Blog Maintence Update 1</div>
    <p> I have set up some basic CSS to add a little bit of color throughout the page. The title bar now has some flair, and the update breaks have some as well.
        I do not anticipate much more than this for now. But this is an exciting update! I will keep you posted.
