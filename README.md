This repository serves as the workshop if you will for my learning of both HTML and CSS with the end point goal of running a small personal blog/website. Should you have any feedback, comments, etc, please reach out to me at toastybread.spotless248@passmail.com. 

I will continue to update my blog testing zone daily if time permits. 


~All the best
